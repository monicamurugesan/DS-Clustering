# DS-Clustering
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters

Two Types:
Hard Clustering: Hard clustering is the type of clustering where each data point either belongs to a cluster completely or not. For example, in the above example each customer is put into one group out of the 10 groups.
Soft Clustering: Soft clustering is another type where instead of putting each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that data point to be in those clusters is assigned. For example, from the above scenario each costumer is assigned a probability to be in either of 10 clusters of the retail store.

Clustering techniques used: Hierarchial[Agglomerative] and K-Means Clustering.
